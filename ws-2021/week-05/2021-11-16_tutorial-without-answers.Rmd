```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = F, message = F, warning = F)

```

These are some completely **optional** exercises dedicated to the topics covered by chapters 5 and 6 of [our web-book](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/index.html).

This sheet makes use of two R packages that you may not yet have installed, `datasauRus` (which contains an educational dataset for demonstrating summary statistics) and `scico` (Scientific Colour Maps palettes). You can install them by running the code chunk below:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("scico") # Scientific Colour Maps palettes
install.packages("datasauRus") # Datasaurus dataset
```

```{r libraries, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(aida)
theme_set(theme_aida()) # use the aida theme for plotting
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      cache = TRUE, fig.align = 'center')
```

# Summary statistics

We will first look at the dataset called `Datasaurus Dozen` which contains 13 sets of observations of two variables, $x$ and $y$. Run the code below to display summary statistics for each of the 13 sets: the mean of $x$, mean of $y$, standard deviation of $x$, standard deviation of $y$, and Pearson correlation between $x$ and $y$.

```{r}
library(datasauRus)
glimpse(datasaurus_dozen)
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    std_dev_x = sd(x),
    std_dev_y = sd(y),
    corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)
    )
```
The summary statistics for each of the 13 datasets are the same. Extend the code below to create a scatterplot for each of the 13 datasets.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, eval = F}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  ... +
  facet_wrap(..., ncol = 4) +
  scico::scale_color_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Visualising multiple distributions in the same plot
`netflix_titles` is a dataset that contains information such as duration, genre, release year, and rating for 7,787 movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The dataset was made available as part of *#TidyTuesday*.

```{r}
netflix_titles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-04-20/netflix_titles.csv')
glimpse(netflix_titles)
```

Run the code chunk below to plot a histogram of movie lengths (in minutes) for four movie genres, *Action & Adventure*, *Comedies*, *Documentaries*, and *Dramas*. (These genres were chosen arbitrarilyâ€”you can try swapping them out for other genres you are more interested in!)

```{r}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration, fill = genre_1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, alpha = .5) +
  scico::scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Duration (minutes)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Duration of films on Netflix",
    fill = "Genre")
```

Histograms with multiple overlapping groups can be hard to read. Edit the code below to get a grouped density plot that looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliasc/statistics/main/week-05/img/plot-1.png)

```{r, eval = F}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = duration,
    fill = genre_1,
    colour = genre_1)
    ) +
  ...
  scico::scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Duration (minutes)",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Duration of films on Netflix",
    fill = "Genre",
    colour = "Genre"
  )
```

Density plots can't show if the data are very sparse or very dense. To get a feeling for how many entries are in each group, we can plot the individual data points for each genre directly by using `geom_point`, and `genre` as the variable on the $x$ axis. (This kind of plot is called a *strip chart*).

```{r}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")
    ) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = genre_1, y = duration, colour = genre_1)) +
  geom_point(size = .5, alpha = .65) +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Genre",
    y = "Duration"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
However, in the plot above, there are too many points plotted on top of each other. To prevent overplotting, we can spread the data points slightly along the $x$ axis.

Edit the code chunk below to get a plot that looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliasc/statistics/main/week-05/img/plot-2.png)

```{r, eval = F}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")
    ) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = genre_1,
    y = duration,
    colour = genre_1)
    ) +
  ...
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Genre",
    y = "Duration (minutes)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

In the preceding plots, the film genres on the $x$ axis are ordered alphabetically, but we may want to sort them by median duration instead:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliasc/statistics/main/week-05/img/plot-3.png)

Edit the code chunk below to rearrange the values on the $x$ axis.

```{r, eval = F}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")
    ) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = ...
    y = duration,
    colour = genre_1)
    ) +
  geom_jitter(size = .5, alpha = .65) +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Genre",
    y = "Duration (minutes)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

We may want to combine density plots and jittered point plots in the same figure (check [Section 6.4 of the web book](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-02-04-geoms.html)).
Extend the code below to get a figure that looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliasc/statistics/main/week-05/img/plot-4.png)

```{r, eval = F}
netflix_titles %>%
  separate(
    col = listed_in,
    into = str_c("genre_", 1:3),
    sep = ",",
    extra = "drop") %>% 
  filter(genre_1 %in% c(
    "Action & Adventure",
    "Comedies",
    "Documentaries",
    "Dramas")
    ) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(str_extract(duration, "[:digit:]+"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = fct_reorder(genre_1, duration, .fun = median),
    y = duration,
    colour = genre_1,
    fill = genre_1)
    ) +
  ... +
  ... +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  scico::scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Genre",
    y = "Duration (minutes)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

New movies and TV shows are added to Netflix every year. You can plot the number of new titles added per year using `geom_line` as shown in [the web book](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/Chap-02-04-geoms.html#line). Use the data in the `type` column of `netflix_titles` to plot two lines, one for newly added TV shows and one for movies:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nataliasc/statistics/main/week-05/img/plot-5.png)

```{r, eval=F}
library(lubridate) # this is helpful for working with dates

netflix_titles %>% 
  mutate(year_added = ...) %>% 
  group_by(...) %>%
  ... %>% 
  ggplot(aes(..., ..., colour = type)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, alpha = .75) +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "New titles added",
    colour = "Type"
  )
```
