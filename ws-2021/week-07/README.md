# Week starts on 2021-11-29
* Slides?
* No new Rmd or Vips, but exam prep -> make last year's mock exam (Vips) available for self-checks
* New exam tasks?

## Midterm exam last year:
Duration: two hours
1. Tidying untidy data from an experiment with reaction times, two experiment conditions, two experiment item types (5 points)
2. Order code snippets: first get summary statistics for a small dataset, then plot a barchart (10 points)
3. Multiple-choice questions about a bad visualisation (2 points)
4. Probabilities of coin flip outcomes (three total coin flips), one question about conditional probability (4 points)
5. Calculate marginal and conditional probabilities given a 4x3 joint probability table (3 points)
6. Stochastic independence (3 points)
7. Assign 9 density/histogram plots to composite random variables (8 points)
8. Parameter estimation, fill in the gaps (4 points)
9. MCMC - match fairy-tale descriptions to formal terms (7 points)
10. Evaluate which of the four code snippets defines a function that returns samples from the posterior predictive distribution of a Binomial model with a beta prior with shape parameters `prior_alpha` and `prior_beta` (multiple correct answers) (8 points)
11. Explain why Bill Gates' sharks/mosquitoes tweet is wrong using notions like "model", "prior", "conditional probability" (6 points)
